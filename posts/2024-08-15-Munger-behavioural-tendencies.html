        <p>A list of Charlie Munger's behavioural tendencies from his famous talk</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The book <em>Poor Charlie’s Almanack</em> is a collection of speeches from the late Charlie Munger. One section of the book describes behaviours (“tendencies”) I have often observed on software projects.</p>
<p>The description was accurate and I decided to re-read the whole chapter and take notes.</p>
<p>Here I summarize notes from Chalie Munger’s speech and also add few of my own comments.</p>
<h4 id="reward-and-punishment-super-response-tendency">1. Reward and Punishment Super Response Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>people respond to incentives and disincentives</li>
<li>rewards and punishments have high impact on work environment motivation and behaviour</li>
<li>Ben Franklin said “appeal to interest, not to reason”</li>
<li>animals and people “repeat behaviour that works” → prompt rewards are better than delayed rewards in changing behaviour (see studies on pigeons by B.F. Skinner)</li>
<li>people are driven by incentives consciously <strong>and subconsciously</strong> → it’s easy to drift into undesirable behaviour and rationalize it afterward (why she/he did it or had to do it)</li>
<li>in business environment watch out for conflicts of interest, examples:
<ul>
<li>vendors that artificially prolong a profitable engagement</li>
<li>consultants offering a “solution” to a complex problem</li>
<li>financial advisors selling commission-based products<br />
</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>even good people can behave immorally with bad incentives (slow drift, unconscious, rationalizing)</li>
<li>“agency cost” → if someone (agent) acts on your behalf, but his/her actions are not in your best interest (cost)
<ul>
<li>there will often be some agency cost in multi-party systems (“some grain is always lost to rats”)</li>
<li>labour agency costs (employees vs. management) can be reduced by good incentives (financial compensation, Daniel Pink’s Autonomy, Mastery (career development), Purpose …)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>people can “game” the system → don’t reward for things that can be easily faked</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="likingloving-tendency">2. Liking/Loving Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>people like being liked or loved</li>
<li>people can ignore faults of loved/liked ones and more easily comply with their wishes</li>
<li>tendency to favor things (people, products, …) associated with object of their liking/loving</li>
<li>can lead to an extreme like self-destruction in help of what is loved</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dislikinghating-tendency">3. Disliking/Hating Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>people easily ignore virtues/benefits of what is disliked/hated</li>
<li>tendency to dislike/hate things (people, products, …) associated with object of their disliking/hating</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="doubt-avoidance-tendency">4. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>it’s not comfortable to have doubt</li>
<li>there is a natural tendency to quickly remove doubt</li>
<li>triggered by combination of puzzlement and stress</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="inconsistency-avoidance-tendency">5. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>people are naturally reluctant to change</li>
<li>when bad habits form over long time it’s difficult to remove them → avoid bad habits from the get-go</li>
<li>internal mental model is kept consistent → facts that are embedded deeper in the mental model are more difficult to change because a lot of other facts are connected to it (change in more “fundamental” facts would have a snowball effect of other changes in the mental model)
<ul>
<li>it’s possible to get “imprisoned in poor conclusions”</li>
<li>build good initial conclusions, because they are hard to change (i.e. inconsistency between new evidence and conclusion tends to be avoided)</li>
<li>people need to re-examine fixed conclusions and attitudes based on <strong>new</strong> evidence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>avoid confirmation bias by searching for evidence disproving a given conclusion or attitude</li>
<li>people who are forced (willingly or unwillingly) to do something repeatedly and over longer time will internalize it and adjust their mental model (i.e. remove the inconsistency) → e.g. teachers teaching something over and over</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="curiosity-tendency">6. Curiosity Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>people are curious</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="kantian-fairness-tendency">7. Kantian Fairness Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>people try to share fairly when something good or bad happens</li>
<li>people get upset if sharing is expected but does not occur
<ul>
<li>“why is the man upset when I didn’t do anything for him?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="envyjealousy-tendency">8. Envy/Jealousy Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>can trigger hatred and injury</li>
<li>people want what other people have</li>
<li>uneven or unfair employee compensation can be a problem</li>
<li>old religions often warn of envy</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="reciprocation-tendency">9. Reciprocation Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>people reciprocate favors and disfavors</li>
<li>reciprocity enhances group cooperation</li>
<li>best antidote to disfavor reciprocity is deferring reaction</li>
<li>reciprocity is present in all good relationships</li>
<li>reciprocating favors partially works on subconscious level →
<ul>
<li>misused by salesmen giving customers small favors in order to win them over</li>
<li>vendors might try to give favors to procurement to trigger the tendency</li>
</ul></li>
<li>obtaining help from god in return for good behaviour is a manifestation of this tendency</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="influence-from-mere-association-tendency">10. Influence from mere association Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>expensive items are perceived as higher-status</li>
<li>products like cars and shavers associated with manliness</li>
<li>we perceive things that are associated with objects that we like/love as good</li>
<li>we perceive things that are associated with objects that we dislike/hate as bad
<ul>
<li>example: employees/companies attribute negative characteristics to their competitors</li>
</ul></li>
<li>people who give negative or unwelcome news are perceived negatively (“don’t kill the messenger”)
<ul>
<li>if “killing messengers carrying bad news” persists no negative news will be reported</li>
<li>encourage people to bring bad new promptly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>association tendency can lead to stereotyping of people based on age, sex or appearance</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="simple-pain-avoiding-psychological-denial">11. Simple pain-avoiding psychological denial</h4>
<ul>
<li>reality can be too painful so some people distort facts to make reality more bearable (e.g. death of child)</li>
<li>drug addicts can be in denial of their current life circumstances</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="excessive-self-regard-tendency">12. Excessive self-regard Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>most drivers rate themselves as above average</li>
<li>mis-appraisals also apply to possessions
<ul>
<li>people think more highly of things they own</li>
<li>same goes for their children → parents think their children are above average</li>
<li>in psychology, it’s called the “endowment effect” → people place higher value on things they own (compared to the same things if they wouldn’t own them)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>people prefer people similar to them
<ul>
<li>people are more willing to help people similar to themselves → this was proven by psychology experiments</li>
<li>during hiring process this can be problematic as people will prefer candidates that are like them
<ul>
<li>bad work environments will hire more bad people thus making the problem worse</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>people spend more on lotteries where they can decide the “winning numbers” (compared to a pre-filled lottery tickets) although the odds of winning are almost the same</li>
<li>people believe more in things they already invested in</li>
<li>employees criticize bad traits in others that they themselves have</li>
<li>employees can over-value their own skills</li>
<li>during interviews people are swayed more by their own impressions of the candidate (especially during face-to-face) than reality would warrant
<ul>
<li>watch out for of marvelous presenters in the workplace</li>
</ul></li>
<li>people sometimes make repeated non-relevant excuses for the fixable poor performance (instead of fixing the behaviour)
<ul>
<li>Charlie Munger says “fixable but unfixed bad performance is bad character”</li>
<li>in workplace antidotes are:
<ol type="1">
<li>meritocratic culture</li>
<li>building up of morale</li>
<li>removing the worst offenders</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>try to be more objective when thinking about yourself, your family and your property</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overoptimism-tendency">13. Overoptimism Tendency</h4>
<ul>

<li>use data</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="deprival-super-reaction-tendency">14. Deprival super Reaction Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>losses hurt more than gains (so-called “loss aversion” in behavioral economy)</li>
<li>it’s very upsetting when someone has “almost something” and then doesn’t get it
<ul>
<li>manifested also in gambling → addictively engineered “near misses” (2x Lemon 1x cherry) slot machines, loot boxes in video games</li>
<li>also manifested in auctions and public biddings → people bid to an extreme price, because they feel deprived of something they “almost owned”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>tendency leads to irrationally strong reaction to small losses or even threats of a losses</li>
<li>employees can have a strong reaction when they get something (even a trivial thing) and afterward they stop getting it or loose it
<ul>
<li>this also applies to things that employees <em>think</em> they will get and later turns out don’t get</li>
</ul></li>
<li>excessive labor demands from employees can lead to demise of the business as a whole</li>
<li>corporations are sometimes “throwing good money after bad” → trying to rescue lost causes</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="social-proof-tendency">15. Social Proof Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>people have a tendency to think and act as people around them</li>
<li>tendency is stronger during stress or puzzlement</li>
<li>stress can be increased by fatigue (people are then more susceptible to social proof tendency)</li>
<li>it’s important to foster good behaviour in organizations</li>
<li>it’s difficult to resist social contagion of bad behaviour</li>
<li>bystander effect is a variant when people’s inactivity is sustained by inactivity of others (this can happen in management meetings as well)</li>
<li>antidote: learn to ignore bad examples</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="contrast-misreaction-tendency">16. Contrast misreaction Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>unable to evaluate things objectively when presented in contrast
<ul>
<li>buying something overpriced because of another recent very expensive purchase (contrast to expensive purchase makes overpriced smaller purchase feel ok)</li>
<li>bad choice of partner because previous partner was even worse</li>
<li>buying real-estate because real-estate broker presents extremely overpriced choices before presenting a merely overpriced choice</li>
<li>judging a project “not so bad” because other projects are even worse</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stress-influence-tendency">17. Stress Influence Tendency</h4>

<li>analyze dis-confirming evidence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>vivid memories and experiences shadow objective recollection</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="use-it-or-loose-it-tendency">19. Use-it-or-loose-it Tendency</h4>

</ul>
<h4 id="twaddle-tendency">22. Twaddle Tendency</h4>
<ul>
<li>some people produce a lot of twaddle</li>
<li>keep twaddling people out of serious work</li>

<h4 id="reason-respecting-tendency">23. Reason respecting Tendency</h4>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>people sometimes accept wrong or illogical reasons (see Ellen Langer photocopier experiment about cutting in line)</li>
<li>make sure reasons are correct</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Charlie Munger says these tendencies are just one way to slice and dice human behaviour. There could be better and more efficient ways of categorizing them, however I find the list very useful and intuitive.</p>
